# WireShape

*WireShape CNC* is a cnc-wirebending machine and machine-specifc CAM control software. Our low-cost machine design is
similar to commercially available wire benders (such as the DI Wire), but constructed from widely available
3D-printer components, 3D-printed mechanics, stepper motors, open source control electronics, and a CNC-milled wooden base frame.
